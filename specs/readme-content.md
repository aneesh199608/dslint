Design System Tokenizer helps you detect and fix missing design tokens on selected layers.

It identifies properties that are not bound to design system variables such as colors, typography, spacing (padding and gap), fills, and stroke, and automatically applies the closest matching token. Color tokens are applied using a priority order: mode first, followed by base tokens if no mode-specific match is found to enable Light/Dark theming.
